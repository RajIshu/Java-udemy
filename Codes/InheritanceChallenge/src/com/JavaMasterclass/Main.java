	    Object Class:
	    ------------
	    Object class is present in java.lang package.

	    Every class in Java is directly or indirectly derived from the Object class.

	    If a class does not extend any other class then it is a direct child class of
	    Object and if extends another class then it is indirectly derived.

	    Therefore, the Object class methods are available to all Java classes.

	    Hence, Object class acts as a root of inheritance hierarchy in any Java Program.

	    The Object class, in the java.lang package, sits at the top of the class hierarchy
	    tree. Every class is a descendant, direct or indirect, of the Object class.

	    Object class is the super class for all user defined and predefined class.

	    We don't need to extend it explicitly it extends automatically when we are writing
	    program because our program imports java.util.lang package.

    // CHALLENGE:
        // Start with a base class of a Vehicle, then create a Car class that inherits from this base class.
        // Finally, create another class, a specific type of Car that inherits from the Car class.
        // You should be able to hand steering, changing gears, and moving (speed in other words).
        // You will want to decide where to put the appropriate state and behaviours (fields and methods).
        // As mentioned above, changing gears, increasing/decreasing speed should be included.
        // For you specific type of vehicle you will want to add something specific for that type of car.
