          Unrestricted access to this class.
        - Other Access Modifiers:
            1. Private - No other class can access this class
            2. Protected - It allows classes in this package to access this class.

        - Variables defined inside a Class is known as Class Variables or Member Variables.
          But most commonly they are known as FIELDS.
          These variables are accessible from anywhere within the class.
        - Defining variables inside a class requires defining access modifiers for that variable.
          Mostly, Private access modifier is used with Class Variables.
