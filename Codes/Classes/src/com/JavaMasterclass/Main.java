	/* OBJECTS:
	    - Every real world Object has two major characteristics:
	        1. State
	        2. Behavior

	    - State is nothing but specification of the system
	      Like, a computer's RAM, type of OS it is running, it's storage capacity, etc.

	    - Behavior for computer would be booting up, shutting down, giving output, printing something,
	      performing calculation, etc.

	    Similar to this, Objects in OOP i.e., software objects also have STATE and BEHAVIOR.

	    - State of the software objects are stored in fields known as VARIABLES.
	    - Behaviors of these software objects are exposed through METHODS.


	  CLASS:
	    - Class is a template or a blueprint for creating Objects.

	    - Benefits of Class:
	        1. Basic or primitive data types are limited i.e., int, short, etc.
	        2. Class give us a power to define our own data type called User-defined Data Type.
