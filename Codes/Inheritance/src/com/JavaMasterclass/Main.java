	    INHERITANCE:
	        - Many objects may have same characteristics, but they may also be different.
	          Example:
	            - Apple iPhone
	                - OS: iOS
	                - CPU: A11 Bionic processor
	            - Samsung Galaxy Phones
	                - OS: Android
	                - CPU: Exynos 9825

              Both have OS and CPU, but both are completely different. So, we can create
              a class named 'Phone' and will inherit all the features from it in Apple
              iPhone class and Samsung Galaxy class.

              Here,
                Parent class: Phone
                Child class: Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy

	        -
