        COLLECTION Interface:
        --------------------
        The Collection interface is the root interface of the Java collections framework.

        There is no direct implementation of this interface. However, it is implemented through
        its sub-interfaces like List, Set, and Queue.

        Sub-interfaces of Collection:
        ----------------------------
        1. List Interface:
           --------------
           - The List interface is an ordered collection that allows us to add and remove elements
             like an array.
           - To learn about List more, open List Interface in this project.

        2. Set Interface:
           -------------
           - The Set interface allows us to store elements in different sets similar to the set in mathematics.
           - It cannot have duplicate elements.
           - To learn about List more, open Set Interface in this project.

        3. Queue Interface:
           ---------------
           - The Queue interface is used when we want to store and access elements in First In, First Out(FIFO)
             manner.
