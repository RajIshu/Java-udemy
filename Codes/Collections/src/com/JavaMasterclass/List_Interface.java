        List Interface:
        --------------
           - The List interface is an ordered collection that allows us to add and remove elements
             like an array.

           - In Java, the List interface is an ordered collection that allows us to store and access
             elements sequentially.

           - It extends the Collection interface.

           - Since List is an interface, we cannot create objects from it.

             In order to use functionalities of the List interface, we can use these classes:

                   a. ArrayList
                   b. LinkedList
                   c. Vector
                   d. Stack

             These classes are defined in the Collections framework and implement the List interface.

           - How to use List?
             ---------------
             In Java, we must import java.util.List package in order to use List.

             Example:
                // ArrayList implementation of List
                List<String> list1 = new ArrayList<>();

                // LinkedList implementation of List
                List<String> list2 = new LinkedList<>();

                Here, we have created objects list1 and list2 of classes ArrayList and LinkedList.
                These objects can use the functionalities of the List interface.

           - Methods of List:
             ---------------
             The List interface includes all the methods of the Collection interface. Its because
             Collection is a super interface of List.

             Some commonly used methods of the Collection interface that's also available
             in the List interface are:

                + add()         - adds an element to a list
                + addAll()      - adds all elements of one list to another
                + get()         - helps to randomly access elements from lists
                + iterator()    - returns iterator object that can be used to sequentially access
                                  elements of lists
                + set()         - changes elements of lists
                + remove()      - removes an element from the list
                + removeAll()   - removes all the elements from the list
                + clear()       - removes all the elements from the list (more efficient than removeAll())
                + size()        - returns the length of lists
                + toArray()     - converts a list into an array
                + contains()    - returns true if a list contains specified element
